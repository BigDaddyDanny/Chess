 * 
 * 	High Priority:
 *  - need a way to prevent player from moving their king to a position that would endanger their king
 *  - need a way to determine if king is threatened to determine if win
 *  - need a way so that if the king is threatened then the player MUST make a move to protect their king if possible
 *  - two arraylists of validMoves????(possible to remove invalid king moves in getValidMoves() method?)
 *  ----------------------------------------------------
 *  Low Priority:
 *  - add feature that allows for exchanging of pawn for other piece
